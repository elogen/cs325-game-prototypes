<h2>Connection</h2>
<ul>
    
<li><strong>Iteration</strong>
The new mechanic added is called crash. When cards of the same value and color are placed oposite of each other, all cards in play are removed, and a new card from the deck is placed as the center card. This new mechanic forces the player to be more aware of the cards they are placing, as a crash could make the game imposible to win. (currently there is a bug in which a crash will occasionally cause to of the placement spots to temporarily disapear. causing a second crash will return the two spots.)
</li>
    
<li><strong>How-To Play:</strong>
CLick on one of three cards in your hand, then one of the open spots around the starting card in order to play it. cards can be played if they are 1 above or below the card they are being played on (first round is based off starting card). If no cards can be played, click the deck image in order to get three new cards in your hand.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Connection is a strategic card game in which you plan out your moves in order to connect the most cards possible
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I sorta didn't use a theme, will incorperate one next week as part of my itteration.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
When playing Connection, the main player experience goal is for the player to think strategically in terms of what cards to play when. Another experience goal is for the player to feel relaxed when playing.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
 The main mechanic in Connection is playing cards ontop of other cards. The way this works is that cards that are within 1 value up or down can be played ontop of each other. For example: a 3 can be played on a 4 or 2. At the start, cards can be played based on the central card, with four slots available to play in around the card. If no cards are playable, the deck image can be clicked to cycle in three new cards. The game ends when all cards are played, or no more cards can be played.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The main goal of the prototype wsas to see how the mechanics operate and feel within a digital space, as the aim for Connection is to be a simple alternative to solitaire.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
One of the unique aspects is the simple and easy to use mechanics. Another selling point is the low difficulty level, allowing the players to relax when playing.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Since this is a card game, there isn't really any premise or setting, though I'm planning on adding one in for the iteration
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
No real story since it's a card game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is casual gamers, and anyone that is looking to relax or for something simple that will pass the time.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Due to the game being random, playtime depends on the cards. Average playtime is between 3-6 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
While there are some strategies that can be applied to Connection, a portion of the game is decided purely by luck, and that is the card that you start with, and the cards that you draw. Due to the game being heavily luck based, it’s difficult to have a concrete strategy. However, the game itself isn’t very difficult, and oftentimes you can win or come very close to winning, simply by playing cards as you get them. The only real strategy to guarantee a win is to keep track of all the cards you have played, and figure out when to play a card and when to hold on to one, based on the remaining cards in the deck/discard pile.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets I made myself in Aseprite (cards, deck image, background)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game that is closest in design is Solitaire, seeing as I took inspiration from it when making Connection.

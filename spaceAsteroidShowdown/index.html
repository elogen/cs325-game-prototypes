<h2>Space Asteroid Showdown</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Take control of the blackhat asteroid as you blast your way through increasingly difficult waves of whitehats, in order to destroy Earth
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I did a mix of both cowboys and asteroids plummeting towards Earth.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The input consist of player movement and shooting, sticking to the side-scrolling shooter genre. One distinct difference in the game is that enemies spawn randomly in time, speed, and position. Their is also an increase in difficulty as the game progresses. The longer you play, the more enemies that you will encounter at one time. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game? Players will use quick reactions to avoid enemies and their projectiles, in order to survive for a long period of time and set high-scores.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
 The main mechanics in Space Asteroid Showdown are moving and shooting. The player can move their asteroid using WASD and shoot with the Spacebar. The goal is simply to survive as long as possible and destroy as many enemies as you can. The game is very much modeled after older arcade games in which the end goal is a new high-score rather than an actual end. The random spawning of enemies is meant to add some variety to gameplay. In the actual game, I would want to include multiple types of enemies, and different power-ups for the player to get.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The mechanic being evaluated is random spawning/difficulty ramp. What I mean by this is that I wanted to explore the ability to create enemies in random locations, and also to increase over time, the difficulty of the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
One of the unique aspects is the strange theme in which you play as a cowboy asteroid, who is also the villian since he is trying to destroy Earth. Another is the random enemy spawn and difficulty ramp.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The world is deep space, in which there exists sentient asteroids. Among these asteroids is one seeking revenge, the blackhat asteroid. A long time ago, the blackhat asteroid's father set out to visit a far off planet known as Earth, but he never returned. Blackhat decided he was done waiting, hoping his father would return. So he set out to destroy Earth, his trust comet revolver (artwork pending) with him. However, there was a group of asteroids dedicated to keeping the peace in space, known as the whitehats. After hearing of Blackhat's plans, the whitehats quickly moved in to stop him.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Since this is meant to be an arcade style game, the only existing story elements are the backstory.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is anyone that enjoys old arcade style games or loves to compete against others to get high-scores 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The length depends on the skill of the player, with the final difficulty ramp being aroud 4 minutes, most players will probably die soon after that time.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The only strategy I can think of is knowing when to avoid enemies rather than trying to destroy them, or in other words not getting to greedy for points because you'll end up getting yourself killed.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Most assets I made myself with my limmited photoshop skills.

<li>Whitehat/Blackhat asteroids: made myself in photoshop</li>
<li>Comet shots: made myself in photoshop</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here. There are a lot of side-scrolling shooters that exist, many of which are extremely similar to my game. Of the Phaser examples, the closest thing would be the invaders game, which is what I looked at when making my enemies shoot and my player lives system.

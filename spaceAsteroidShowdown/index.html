<h2>Space Asteroid Showdown</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Take control of the blackhat asteroid as you blast your way through increasingly difficult waves of whitehats, in order to destroy Earth
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I did a mix of both cowboys and asteroids, with the scene being space, and the characters being asteroid cowboys.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The input consist of player movement and shooting, sticking to the side-scrolling shooter genre. One distinct difference in the game is that enemies spawn randomly in time, speed, and position. Their is also an increase in difficulty as the game progresses. The longer you play, the more enemies that you will encounter at one time. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will use quick reactions to avoid enemies and their projectiles, in order to survive for a long period of time and set high-scores.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
 The main mechanics in Space Asteroid Showdown are moving and shooting. The player can move their asteroid using WASD and shoot with the Spacebar. The goal is simply to survive as long as possible and destroy as many enemies as you can. The game is very much modeled after older arcade games in which the end goal is a new high-score rather than an actual end. The random spawning of enemies is meant to add some variety to gameplay. In the actual game, I would want to include multiple types of enemies, and different power-ups for the player to get.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The mechanic being evaluated is random spawning/difficulty ramp. What I mean by this is that I wanted to explore the ability to create enemies in random locations, and also to increase over time, the difficulty of the game. Primarily I wanted to make sure that the two parts worked well together, keeping the game random while making it more difficult.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
One of the unique aspects is the strange theme in which you play as a cowboy asteroid, in a world of sentient asteroids. Another feature is that you take on the role of the villian which is fairly uncommon in games. The random enemy spawn and random enemy fire greatly adds to the game as it is garunteed to be different with every new game. The last feature is the gradually increasing difficulty that is linked with how long you have been playing.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The world is deep space, in which there exists sentient asteroids. Among these asteroids is one seeking revenge, the blackhat asteroid. A long time ago, the blackhat asteroid's father set out to visit a far off planet known as Earth, but he never returned. Blackhat decided he was done waiting, hoping his father would return. So he set out to destroy Earth, his trust comet revolver (artwork pending) with him. However, there was a group of asteroids dedicated to keeping the peace in space, known as the whitehats. After hearing of Blackhat's plans, the whitehats quickly moved in to stop him.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Since this is meant to be an arcade style score attack, the only existing story elements are the backstory.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is anyone that enjoys old arcade style games or score attack games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
With the final difficulty ramp being aroud 4.5 minutes, most players will probably die soon after that time. However, this is made to be an endless score attack, meaning that playtime could be very long or very short and is primarily linked to the skill level of the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The only strategy I can think of is knowing when to avoid enemies rather than trying to destroy them, or in other words not getting to greedy for points because you'll end up getting yourself killed.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Most assets I made myself with my limmited photoshop skills.

<li>Comet shots: made myself in photoshop shrkinking and recoloring the asteroid I made, removing the cowboy hat</li>
<li>Enemy shots: made myself in photoshop by </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
There are a lot of side-scrolling shooters that exist, many of which are extremely similar to my game. Of the Phaser examples, the closest example that I saw would be the invaders game, which is what I looked at when making my enemies shoot and my player lives system. The only bits of code that I almost directly copied were the player lives and the enemy shoot function. Everything in the enemy shoot function is the same as in the invaders example, except for the player targeting, to which I opted to calculate the angle to shoot rather than use moveToObject.

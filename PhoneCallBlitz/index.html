<h2>Phone Call Blitz</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Prove your a ohone master by calling as many numbers as you can in one minute.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Phone calls aren't returned
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Mouse, random, achiever, clicker
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player will use quick reactions and percision in order to quickly make phone calls
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The controls are all mouse based, click numbers to add them to the number to call, click the x to delete the most recent number added, click the green phone to call the number. Players have one minute to call as many numbers as possible, making sure the number they call matches the one prompted above the phone.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The main mechanic this prototype focuses on is button pressing to create a sequence, which is used here for players to create a phone number.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Random generation making every playthrough unique</li>
<li>Simple design, making the mechanics and goals obvious without the need for a tutorial</li>
<li>Sound feedback so the player can tell when an action has been done</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You play as a man/woman, who's very lonely, and all you want is to talk to someone. Alas you don't have any friends and don't know anyone's phone number. Solution, use a 10 digit random number generator and call whatever number comes up, hoping that someone answers.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Story is mainly covered in the setting/premise.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Target audience are those that love score attack games or like quick reaction games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game takes 1 minute to play
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The only strategy I can think of is to quickly memorize the given number so that you don't have to stop what your doing to look at the number. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All art assets I made myself, all sound assets I got from freesound.org
<ul>
<li>All phone buttons made in aseprite</li>
<li>Phone background also made in aseprite</li>
<li>The phone beeps and rings were taken from <a href="https://www.freesound.org">freesound.org</a> and edited in audacity</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Not really sure if there is a game too similar to this, seeing ow the whole premise is typing in phone numbers, it's more likely that this mechanic is a small part in a larger game, such as gta.

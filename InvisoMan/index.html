<h2>InvisoMan</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Controls:</strong>
WASD to move. While stationary you are invisible and cannot be caught by the guards. Guards will chase you down when you move.
</li>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Use your powers of invisibility to collect as much information as you can while avoiding the guards.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I picked invisibility.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Direct, randomness, Collector, overhead.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will use strategy and patience to plan their moves and collect the most info.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
How to play is covered in the controls section. The overall gameplay is simple movement and avoiding the guards. If the player is stationairy they become invisible, guards will wander randomly if they can't see the player and cannot catch the player. Once the player is visible the guards will chase after them until they have been caught or turn invisible again.The goal is to simply collect as many pieces of info as you can without being caught. With each piece of info collected, another guard appears to try and catch you, the idea is that the difficulty is linked to the skill of the player, the more skilled the player, the more difficult the game becomes.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The main thing that I wanted to look at with this prototype was the invisibility tied to movement mechanic in which standing still made you invisible to enemies and moving revealed you.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>The unique invisibility mechanic which is linked to movement</li>
    <li>The random spawning of enemies and info that makes each attempt different</li>
    <li>A steady increase in difficulty linked to the skill of the player</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Though I didn't include to much art here to set up a real setting, the idea for the game was to combine the two themes, invisibility and eavesdropper to create a sort of spy/espionage game. The setting would be a number of different embassies that the player would infiltrate in order to listen in on conversations and learn classified information.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Though the game doesn't have any sort of story in its current state, I did have an idea in mind. The story would be of a international spy who was laid off due to a lack of work. The spy then steals a cloaking device goes rouge, with the goal of starting a war. So in a sense, you would be playing as the main antagonist of the game, who is trying to start a world war in order to have a job again.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is score-attack fans who play to get a highscore.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game only takes about 2-3 minutes per life.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
After doing some testing, the most succesful strategy that I saw was being patient and planning out your moves. Since the guards move randomly when you are invisible, it's best to be patient and wait for a good opportunity to make a move towards the info.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Every asset was made from scratch in Aseprite
<ul>
    <li>InvisoMan</li>
    <li>Guards</li>
    <li>info</li>
    <li>Background</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It was actually difficult to find a specific game that is similar to mine. I'm not saying that they don't exist, there are many games like mine, I just couldn't find the names of them as they are quite old.
